The current state of the industry is dangerous and damaging to both #artists and the #environment. I recommend that we all take a few steps back and see what we can do to improve upon some of the current issues, to make it better for everyone, especially artists.

What can we do?

Reduce fraud. Currently, it's far too easy for someone to grab artwork off of the internet, mint it, and sell it as their own. #DeviantArt has been working on this, but it's a band-aid to try and stop it after the artwork has been taken.

Environment. This one baffles me. If we want to care about the environment, then why are so many people so quick to use #ETH to mint the work, knowing how damaging it is? Switching to #TEZ is a good start, but it needs to go much further than this.

Value. This one's tougher, as it gets a little subjective. Artwork should have value that goes beyond money. There's pride and love in both creating and owning work. Value of NFTs are currently tied to how much resale value there is. Once something losing market interest, it becomes worthless. Essentially, it becomes a system to recycle assets in order to make money. The art becomes a tool for the rich to get richer. Basically, it's a Ponzi scheme.

It would be wonderful if there were a way of establishing a floor value by an independent house, not the publisher of the work, and absolutely ban companies or corporations (such as Starbucks and Nike) from participating in the market of sold work.

Currently, when I see people pushing NFTs, I assume that they do not care about the art, the artist, or the environment.

I used to love NFTs. I still could, but I wish would could all agree that anything #blockchain related still has some serious problems to work through first.
